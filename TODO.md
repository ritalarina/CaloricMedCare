Main functionality:
- ~~Formula for calculation (without calorimeter) Toronto formula for major burns: $−4343 + (10.5 × \\%TBSA) + (0.23 × energy intake in kcal) + (0.84 × Harris-Benedict) + (114 × T) − (4.5 × days post-burn)$. 
> ℹ️ **_NOTE:_** This formula uses the information of the previous day, where T is body temperature in °C.~~
- ~~Calculate necessary protein amount (1-15 days - 2g per body kg, afterwards - 1.5 g per body kg)~~
- Calculate necessary daily nutrition formula volume
	- Start with base nutrition.
	- Make other illness selection multiple-choice.
